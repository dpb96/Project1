#Project: Validating the 1991 Study on Left-Handed People and Longevity
This project aims to determine whether the findings of a 1991 study, which suggested that left-handed individuals have a shorter lifespan, still hold true today. Conducted during my internship at MTE, this analysis employs various tools and methodologies, including Excel, SQL, RStudio, Pandas, Matplotlib, and statistical analysis techniques.

Overview
Objective: To re-evaluate the 1991 study on the lifespan of left-handed people.
Internship: Conducted at MTE.
Tools and Technologies:
Excel for data organization and preliminary analysis.
SQL for database management and data extraction.
RStudio for advanced statistical analysis.
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
Statistical analysis to interpret the data and validate findings.
Methodology
The project involved a comprehensive approach:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant datasets from various sources.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Using Pandas and SQL to clean and organize the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting in-depth analysis using RStudio to identify any patterns or discrepancies in the data.
Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data with Matplotlib to better understand the trends.
Validation: Comparing the results with the original 1991 study to assess its validity.
Additional Resources
Internet: Utilized for supplementary information and data sources.
AI: Leveraged for data analysis and validation processes.
Conclusion
This project seeks to provide a modern perspective on the longevity of left-handed individuals, revisiting a significant study from 1991 with updated tools and methodologies.
